# Dr. Josh Starmer of StatQuest: ML with Naive Bayes and ChIP-seq 

## Presenter: Dr. Josh Starmer of [StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw) 

Location: **VIRTUAL MEETING** 

Day and Time: Thursday October 19, 2023 @ 3pm

### Details

My talk will cover two topics: first, we'll talk about ChIP-seq, a molecular 
method for examining how the genome is regulated, and then second, we'll talk 
about Naive Bayes, a simple, yet surprisingly effective AI method. Once we 
understand both techniques, I'll show how Naive Bayes can be applied to ChIP-seq 
data to predict active regions in the genome. For those interested in trying this 
out on their own, I'll also provide annotated code that shows how to do every 
single step in R, a programming language for data analysis.


###  Bio

Josh Starmer is the person behind the popular YouTube channel, “StatQuest with 
Josh Starmer.” Since 2016, Josh has used an innovative and unique visual style 
to clearly explain Statistics, Data Science and Machine Learning concepts and 
algorithms to curious people all over the world. Rather than dumb down the 
material, Josh brings people up with simple examples worked through, step-by-step, 
using pictures to make sure every main idea is easy to understand and remember. 
By breaking down even the most complicated algorithms into bite sized pieces, 
StatQuest has helped people, all over the world, win data science competitions, 
pass exams, graduate from school, and get jobs and promotions. Josh is called 
the “Patron Saint of Silicon Valley” because people binge watch StatQuest 
videos before job interviews, the “Bill Nye of Statistics” by making the topic 
fun and exciting and the “Bob Ross of Data” by cutting through the hype and 
helping people relax with silly songs.
