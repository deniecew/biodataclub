### Details
Over the last few years, there has been tremendous progress in natural language processing techniques. Moffitt has millions of medical notes containing untold information and insights. We demonstrate ongoing work on the Health Data Services team to leverage modern techniques for the identification of undocumented medical conditions in clinical notes. Our demonstration uses the ICD-10-CM ontology, vector embeddings of ICD-10 codes, AWS Comprehend Medicalâ€™s API, and a simple machine learning classifier identify patients with cachexia.
