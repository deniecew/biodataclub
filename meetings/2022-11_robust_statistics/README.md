# Robust Statistics in Python and R

## Presenter: [Denise Kalos](mailto:denise.kalos@moffitt.org)

Location: **VIRTUAL MEETING** 

Day and Time: Thursday, November 17th 2022 @ 3pm

### Details
The goal is to introduce the audience to robust statistics, a rather under-utilized area of statistics.  We will discuss when it is appropriate to use robust methods rather than parametric or nonparametric approaches.  The talk will include how robust statistics are being used in current literature and examples with packages in both Python and R.  Installation of Python and R on your machine would be beneficial, but is not necessary to follow along.
